# Image Colorizer

This is a web application that converts black-and-white images into color using deep learning. The project utilizes OpenCV's deep neural network (DNN) module with a pre-trained colorization model.

## Features
- Converts grayscale images to color with a user-friendly interface.
- Side-by-side comparison of original and colorized images.
- Ability to download both original and colorized images.

## Demo
